# SUDOKU

Welcome to the Sudoku Game, a dynamic and engaging puzzle game built with React! This project was developed to enhance my React skills and to have some fun.

## Features
- *Dynamic Puzzle Generation*: Each Sudoku puzzle is generated dynamically using a backfill algorithm.
- *Randomized Subgrid*: The randomizeSubGrid method ensures that a 3x3 grid is filled with numbers from 1 to 9 in random order, providing a unique puzzle each time.
